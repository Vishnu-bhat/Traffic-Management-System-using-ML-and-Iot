# üö¶ Intelligent Traffic Management System

A real-time, AI-powered traffic optimization platform developed in collaboration with the University of Gustave Eiffel, France, funded by CIFIPRA. The project leverages computer vision, machine learning, and IoT to minimize congestion at road intersections.

This project is a real-time, AI-driven traffic signal optimization system designed to minimize average vehicle delay across intersections using live video feeds, IoT infrastructure, and machine learning.

## üåê Overview

The system integrates live video processing, predictive modeling, and a responsive web dashboard to analyze and optimize traffic signal timing dynamically.
